    <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
    <p><strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong></p>
    <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a>
        into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the
        original perfect-ass website:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        <li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
        <li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
        <li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
    <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
