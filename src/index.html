    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Software architect, software engineer, software developer and coder: 
        the latter is the least skilled but Coder&apos;s Dungeon sounds better than Engineer&apos;s Dungeon.</p>
        <p>Coders here may learn something about programming and computer science, 
            and even some engineers and architects that I know too...</p>
        <p>I do not pretend to be the best software developer/engineer/architect/whatever in the World, 
            I just aim to be better than I am now, to learn new things and exchange knowledge with other people.</p>
        <p>You can&apos;t know what you can learn from people...</p>
        <p>Have fun. <em>KernelPanicX</em></p>

    <h3>Clarification</h3>
    <p>This website is based on the concepts
        expressed <a href='https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/'>here</a> and <a href='http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/'>here</a>.<br/>
        All applications that follow are based on a simple pure javascript engine that I wrote.<br/>
        Tools are developed while making the simple games presented here.<br/>
        TODOS are for me.

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <h3>Hex Map Drawer</h3>
    <p>A simple tool to draw hexagonal map by selecting hexagons. Inspiration comes 
        from <a href='https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/'>Red&nbsp;Blod&nbsp;Games</a>.
        It&apos;s possible to copy selected coordinates to clipboard.<br/>
        Just use buttons on the top.<br/>
        <strong>TODO:</strong> fix colors.
    </p>
    <button class='btn-launch' data-app='draw-grid'>Draw</button>
    <h3>Hex Map Loader</h3>
    <p>
        Paste coordinates from the Map Drawer into the text field and watch the result.<br/>
        <strong>TODO:</strong> print the map, error check.
    </p>
    <label for="map-data">Map Coords</label>
    <input type='text' name = 'map-data' id='map-data' /><br/>
    <button class='btn-launch' data-app='load-grid'>Load</button>
    <h3>Hexagon Drawer</h3>
    <p>
        Free drawing into the hexagon. You can save the image too...<br/>
        <strong>TODO:</strong> fix undo button and save hexagon in the image.
